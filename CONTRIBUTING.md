- Use animations and transitions appropriately
- Ensure the app works well on different screen sizes

## üìö Educational Content Guidelines

### Lesson Content
- Align with 6th-grade mathematics standards
- Use clear, age-appropriate language
- Provide step-by-step guidance
- Include real-world examples when possible

### Questions and Assessments
- Create questions that reinforce learning
- Use multiple question types (multiple choice, interactive, etc.)
- Provide helpful hints and explanations
- Ensure questions are challenging but not frustrating

## üîç Review Process
