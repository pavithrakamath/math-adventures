    "hint": "It's tough to compare fractions just by looking at them when their denominators (the bottom numbers) are different. To compare them, we need to make their denominators the same. This is called finding a 'common denominator'.\n\nHere's the cool part: a common denominator is just a 'common multiple' of the two bottom numbers. A common multiple is a number that both numbers can divide into evenly.\n\nLet's find a common multiple for 3 and 5. An easy way is to just multiply them: 3 ร 5 = 15. So, 15 is a common denominator!\n\nNow, convert both fractions to have 15 on the bottom, and the bigger one will be easy to spot!"
