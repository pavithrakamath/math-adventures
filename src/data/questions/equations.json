    "hint": "Think of an equation as a perfectly balanced scale. If you do something to one side, you have to do the exact same thing to the other side to keep it balanced.\n\nOur goal is to get 'x' all by itself. Right now, it has '+ 5' with it. What's the opposite of adding 5? If we do that to both sides of the equals sign, what answer do we get for x?"

    "errorDescription": "The student seems to be having trouble with division to solve for a variable. They might be trying to subtract instead.",
    "hint": "Let's decode '3y'. In algebra, when a number and a letter are right next to each other, it means they are multiplied. So, this equation is '3 times y equals 21'.\n\nTo find 'y', we need to get it by itself. What's the opposite operation of multiplying by 3? Let's do that to both sides of the equation to find our answer!"

    "hint": "This is a two-step equation. Let's solve it step by step:\n\nStep 1: Get rid of the -3 by adding 3 to both sides\n2x - 3 + 3 = 7 + 3\n2x = 10\n\nStep 2: Get x by itself by dividing both sides by 2\n2x รท 2 = 10 รท 2\nx = 5\n\nRemember: whatever you do to one side, do to the other!"

    "errorDescription": "The student may be confused about solving equations with division. They need to multiply both sides by 4.",
    "hint": "When we see z/4, that means 'z divided by 4'. To get z by itself, we need to do the opposite of dividing by 4. What's the opposite of dividing by 4? If we multiply both sides by 4, what do we get?"
